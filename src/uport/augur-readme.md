This directory is a clone of uport's connect package. (https://github.com/uport-project/uport-connect)

If you want to test the example uPort connection and how it works you'll need to do the following:

git clone https://github.com/uport-project/uport-connect
cd uport-connect
npm install
npm run build-dist
open examples/example.html

You'll also need to create a new identity in one of their mobile apps to use to actually authenticate with uPort.
